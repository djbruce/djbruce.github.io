	<p class="lead">"Justice. To be ever ready to admit that another person is something quite different from what we read when he is there (or when we think about him). Or rather, to read in him that he is certainly something different, perhaps something completely different from what we read in him. Every being cries out silently to be read differently.‚Äù ~ Simone Weil</p>

<h3>Expository Writing</h3>
<p>I find writing to be the best way for me to really understand a subject. Something about writing makes me sort out and organize my thoughts, and so on my mathematical journey I have written a fair deal of notes about things -- mostly commutative algebra and algebraic geometry stuff. Someday I plan on going through these, posting the ones, which I think might be useful to others and are not too out of shape. Until I get around to doing this enjoy Eisenbud Cake!</p>
