<h3> Research Presentations</h3>

<p><b>Disclaimer:</b> For many of my presentations I have included the notes I used
when giving the talk. All of these notes are <em>extremely</em> raw and unpolished i.e. they 
most likely are filled with many errors, typos, and mistakes not to mention things that only 
make sense to me. So be cautious when reading them, and keep their context in mind.

		Classically, Noether normalization says that any projective (resp. affine) variety of dimension n over a field admits a finite surjective morphism to P^n (resp. A^n). I will discuss whether we can generalize such theorems to other bases like Z, C[t], etc. This is based on joint work with Daniel Erman.

		Given k homogenous polynomials in n+1 variables what do we expect about the dimension of their zero set? Well a good guess would be that each polynomial imposes a dimension one condition and so their zero set should have dimension n-(k+1). In this talk I will discuss how, over a finite field, we may put this intuition to the test. This is based on joint work with Daniel Erman.

		Given a graph one may obtain a reducible algebraic curve by associating a P^1 to each vertex with two P^1s intersecting if there is an edge between the associated vertices. Such curve are called graph curves, or line arrangements, and were introduced by Bayer and Eisenbud in studying Greens conjecture. I will discuss how the combinatorics of the graph affect the Betti table of its associated curve. In particular, I will present formulas for the Betti table for all graph curves of genus zero and one. Additionally, I will give formulas for the graded Betti numbers for a class of curves of higher genus. This talk is based on joint work with Pete Vermeire, Evan Nash, Ben Perez, and Pin-Hung Kao.

		Algebraic geometers have long been interested in studying methods of resolving singularities of algebraic varieties. In 1964 Hironaka showed that over a field of characteristic zero, every algebraic variety is birationally equivalent to a smooth projective algebraic variety. While this in essence settled the matter of resolving singularities, at least in characteristic zero, in the roughly fifty years since there has been considerable interest in classifying singularities and explicitly describing a resolution of specific classes of singularities. 
Utilizing tools from algebraic geometry and valuation theory we provide an explicit description of the resolution of the singularities of plane curves defined by x^a=y^b in k^2 where k is a field and a and b are relatively prime integers greater than one. Additionally, we show how this resolution process is related to the continued fraction expansion of a/b. Finally, we provide a new geometric way of representing these resolutions as a diagram of nested triangles, which encapsulates the resolution process. We are hopeful that this diagram also contains other information classifying the singularities of the curve such as its log canonical threshold.

		With the rise in prominence of high dimensional data, multivariate measures of center have become very important. In this paper we focus on one multivariate measure of center - the geometric median, which is defined as the minimizer of the sum of distances to the data points. We study the quantitative robustness of the geometric median. Showing that for a non-degenerate distribution of N points, altering k points can only change the median by at most O(k/N). Taking advantage of this robustness we introduce a robust form of Principle Component Analysis (PCA), which is based on what we call the median covariance matrix. Since there are several natural matrix norms, we look at the notion of the geometric median in general Banach Spaces. We conclude by proving that the geometric median is robust in all uniformly convex Banach spaces.		</div>
