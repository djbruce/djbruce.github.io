<p><b>Disclaimer:</b> For many of my presentations I have included the notes I used
when giving the talk. These notes are <em>extremely</em> raw and unpolished. They 
almost surely contain many errors, typos, and mistakes; not to mention things that only 
make sense to me. So when reading them be catious and keep their context in mind.

		Classically, Noether normalization says that if $X$ is an $n$-dimensional projective (resp. affine) variety over a field $\kk$ then their exists a finite morphism $\phi:X\rightarrow\P^n_{\kk}$ (resp. $\A^n_{\kk}$). By studying the distribution of systems of parameters we show similar results hold when $\kk$ is replaced by certain dimension one integral domains namely $\Z$ or $\F_q[t]$.

		Classically, Noether normalization says that any projective (resp. affine) variety of dimension n over a field admits a finite surjective morphism to P^n (resp. A^n). I will discuss whether we can generalize such theorems to other bases like Z, C[t], etc. This is based on joint work with Daniel Erman.

		Given k homogenous polynomials in n+1 variables what do we expect about the dimension of their zero set? Well a good guess would be that each polynomial imposes a dimension one condition and so their zero set should have dimension n-(k+1). In this talk I will discuss how, over a finite field, we may put this intuition to the test. This is based on joint work with Daniel Erman.

		Given a graph one may obtain a reducible algebraic curve by associating a P^1 to each vertex with two P^1s intersecting if there is an edge between the associated vertices. Such curve are called graph curves, or line arrangements, and were introduced by Bayer and Eisenbud in studying Greens conjecture. I will discuss how the combinatorics of the graph affect the Betti table of its associated curve. In particular, I will present formulas for the Betti table for all graph curves of genus zero and one. Additionally, I will give formulas for the graded Betti numbers for a class of curves of higher genus. This talk is based on joint work with Pete Vermeire, Evan Nash, Ben Perez, and Pin-Hung Kao.

<h3>Expository Presentations</h3>

<p> Additionally, through various programs &ndash; especially math circles &ndash; I have given numerous outreach presentations.
A list of these can be found <a href="/outreach">here</a>. Additionally, a list of presentations I gave as a undergraduate can be found
<a href="/undergrad">here</a>.</p>
