<h3> Research Presentations</h3>

<p><b>Disclaimer:</b> For many of my presentations I have included the notes I used
when giving the talk. All of these notes are <em>extremely</em> raw and unpolished i.e. they 
most likely are filled with many errors, typos, and mistakes not to mention things that only 
make sense to me. So be cautious when reading them, and keep their context in mind.

		Classically, Noether normalization says that any projective (resp. affine) variety of dimension n over a field admits a finite surjective morphism to P^n (resp. A^n). I will discuss whether we can generalize such theorems to other bases like Z, C[t], etc. This is based on joint work with Daniel Erman.

		Given k homogenous polynomials in n+1 variables what do we expect about the dimension of their zero set? Well a good guess would be that each polynomial imposes a dimension one condition and so their zero set should have dimension n-(k+1). In this talk I will discuss how, over a finite field, we may put this intuition to the test. This is based on joint work with Daniel Erman.
