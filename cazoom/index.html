<p>
Expander graphs in general, and Ramanujan graphs , in particular,  have played a major role in  computer science in the last 5 decades  and more recently also in pure math. The first explicit construction of bounded degree expanding graphs was given by Margulis in the early 70's. In mid 80' Margulis and Lubotzky-Phillips-Sarnak provided Ramanujan graphs which are optimal such expanders. 
 <br>
 <br>
In recent years a high dimensional theory of expanders is emerging.  A notion of topological expanders was defined by Gromov in 2010 who proved that the complete d-dimensional simplical complexes are such. He raised the basic question of existence of such bounded degree complexes of dimension d>1. 
<br>
 <br>
This question was answered recently affirmatively (by  T. Kaufman, D. Kazdhan and A. Lubotzky for d=2 and by S. Evra and T. Kaufman for general d) by showing that the d-skeleton of (d+1)-dimensional Ramanujan complexes provide such topological expanders. We will describe these developments and the general area of high dimensional expanders.

      <div class="panel-body"><h5>Groups' approximation, stability and high dimensional expanders</h5>

<p>
Several well-known open questions, such as: are all groups sofic or hyperlinear?,  have a common form: can all groups be approximated by asymptotic homomorphisms into the symmetric
groups Sym(n) (in the sofic case) or the  unitary groups U(n) (in the hyperlinear case)? In the case of U(n), the question can be asked with respect to different metrics and norms. 
We answer, for the first time, one of these versions, showing that there exist fintely presented groups which are  not approximated by U(n) with respect to the Frobenius (=L_2) norm.
<br>
 <br>
The strategy is via the notion of "stability": some higher dimensional cohomology vanishing phenomena is proven to imply stability  and using  high dimensional expanders, it is shown that 
some non-residually finite groups  (central extensions of some lattices in p-adic Lie groups)  are Frobenious stable and hence cannot be Frobenius approximated. 
<br>
 <br>
All notions will be explained. (Joint work with M, De Chiffre, L. Glebsky and A. Thom.)
