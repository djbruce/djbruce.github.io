	<p class="lead">Experimental Talks in AG - Exploring ways to virtually communicate math<p>
	
	<p>
	The recent shift from in-person to online talks provides us with an
	opportunity to explore new and interesting ways to communicate and
	learn things related to algebraic geometry. The goal of this seminar
	is to provide a space for speakers and audience members to do this
	exploration.
	<br>
	<br>
	Each speaker will be given 50 minutes to create and lead an
	environment where topics related to algebraic geometry can be
	communicated and learned. How the speaker uses their time and
	creates such an environment is entirely up to them. They may try
	mixing pre-recorded and live aspects of a talk, they might try
	leading group work, who knows, it is entirely up to the speaker. The
	only request made of speakers is that they think critically about
	new ways to best use their time to promote the communication and
	learning of math. After the 50 minutes, a short group discussion
	will be held discussing how this form of online math communication
	went, and how it might be built upon. Everyone participating is
	asked to keep in mind that this is a place for experimentation.
	<br>
	<br>
	This event is being organized by Juliette Bruce in association with the Algebraic Geometry Syndicate (AGS) discord server.
	Updates about the talks will be posted both here and on the AGS discord server. If you would like to join the AGS discord
	server please email juliette.bruce 'at' math.wisc.edu.
