<h3>Software Packages</h3>
<p>I am a frequent Macaulay2 user, and have participated in multiple Macaulay2 workshops. Through these and other avenues I have worked on the following packages:</p>

<ul>

<li>
<span class="title"><a href="https://www.math.utah.edu/~schwede/M2/PosChar.m2">PosChar.m2</a> - a package for positive characteristic methods in Macaulay2</span>
<br />with <span class="coauthor">Erin Bela,  Daniel J. Hern√°ndez, Zhibek Kadyrsizova, 
Moty Katzman, Sara Malec, Pedro Teixeira, Karl Schwede, and Emily Witt</span>
</li>

</ul>

<h3>Snippets of Code & Programs</h3>
<p>When trying to understand a problem I often find it useful to look at a large number of examples. This often helps me understand both what I should be trying to prove, as well as how I should be trying to prove it. Frequently this means writing Macaulay2 code to compute various things. These are some of the snippets of code I figure might be interesting to others. (Full-Disclaimer: Most of this code is quite rough, and was written to accomplish specific goals I had in mind. So... it is probably not pretty, optimized, or polished.)</p>
