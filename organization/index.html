<h3>Math Circles</h3>
<p>I am a one of student organizers of the <a href="https://www.math.wisc.edu/wiki/index.php/Madison_Math_Circle">Madison Math Circle</a>, which seeks to cultivate an excitement and passion for mathematics in middle and high school students. One of my goals in working with this organization is broadening its reach and impact. We have worked towards this by beginning to hold meetings off campus at local schools and partnering with other community organizations.
Previously I was involved as an volunteer and student organizer of the <a href="http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/mathcircle/">Michigan Math Circle</a>.</p>
