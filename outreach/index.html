<p>I believe strongly in the importance of inclusivity, diversity, and justice, and am passionate about promoting these values within the mathematical and academic community. If you are also passionate about these topics and would like to chat, or better yet have ideas for action, please contact me!</p>
<p>One important step part in these regards is recognizing and aknowldging that our communities (mathematical, academic, societal) have historically been, and continue to be, places in which people from various groups are unwelcome, with this unwelcomeness being expressed through bias, discrimination, hate, and violence. In recognizing this it is important to commit ourselves to changing this situation. For me personally, I have tried to capture my commitment to this in the following <a href="">statment</a>. </p>

<h3>Math Circles</h3>
<p>Currently I am a one of student organizers of the <a href="https://www.math.wisc.edu/wiki/index.php/Madison_Math_Circle">Madison Math Circle</a>, which is an outreach program seeking to cultivate an excitement and passion for mathematics in middle and high school students. One of my goals in working with this organization is broadening its impact and reach. We have worked towards this by beginning to hold meetings off campus at local schools and partnering with other community organizations.
Previously I was involved as an volunteer and student organizer of the <a href="http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/mathcircle/">Michigan Math Circle</a>.</p>
