<h3> Blogging </h3>
<p> I occasionally share my mathematical ramblings on my personal blog Yellow Pigs. (Bonus points to anyone who knows why it is called ``Yellow Pigs''.) For the last year I have also been a contributor for the AMS Graduate Student Blog, and am the managing editor. During this time I have written about a wide range of things, from the fun to the serious, related to math and grad school. A selection of my posts include:</p>

Someday I plan on going through these and posting the ones, which I think might be useful to others and are not to out of shape. Until I get around to doing this enjoy Eisenbud Cake!</p>
