<h3> Blogging </h3>
<p> For the last year I have also been a contributor for the <a href="http://blogs.ams.org/mathgradblog/">AMS Graduate Student Blog</a>. (Currently I am one of the the managing editors.) During this time I have written about a wide range of things related to math, grad school, and academia. One topic I frequently enjoy writing about is how mathematics can be a more inclusive and justice community. A selection of my posts include:</p>

<h3>Expository Writing</h3>
<p>I find writing to be the best way for me to really understand a subject. Something about writing makes me sort out and organize my thoughts, and so on my mathematical journey I have written a fair deal of notes about things -- mostly commutative algebra and algebraic geometry stuff. Someday I plan on going through these, posting the ones, which I think might be useful to others and are not too out of shape. Until I get around to doing this enjoy Eisenbud Cake!</p>
