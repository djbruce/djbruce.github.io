<p>I frequently enjoy programming, most often working in either Macaulay2, MatLab, or HTML/CSS/Bootstrap, however, I also have (limited) experience with Python and Sage. A few of the more substantive projects I have worked are listed below.</p>

<h4>SyzygyData</h4>

    <div class="col-xs-8">
		<p> A central open question in the study of syzygies is to describe the
		Betti table of \(\mathbb{P}^{n}\) under the degree \(d\) Veronese
		embedding. While the case when \(n=1\) is fully understood and classical
		&mdash; the minimal resolution is given by an Eagon-Northcott complex
		&mdash; in higher dimensions this problem is almost entirely open. For
		example, when \(n=2\), not only is a complete description unknown, but
		only a handful of examples have ever been computed. The
		goal of this project is to use numerical linear algebra and high
		throughput, distributed computing to systematically gather new examples
		of Betti tables of Veronese embeddings of \(\mathbb{P}^n\).
