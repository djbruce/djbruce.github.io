<p>I frequently enjoy programming, most often working in either Macaulay2, MatLab, or HTML/CSS/Bootstrap, however, I also have (limited) experience with Python and Sage. A few of the more substantive projects I have worked are listed below.</p>

<h3>SyzygyData</h3> - <h4> A Online Database of Syzygies</h4>
<hr>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-xs-12">
		<p style="font-size: 14"> A central open question in the study of syzygies is to describe the
		Betti table of \(\mathbb{P}^{n}\) under the degree \(d\) Veronese
		embedding. While the case when \(n=1\) is fully understood and classical
		&mdash; the minimal resolution is given by an Eagon-Northcott complex
		&mdash; in higher dimensions this problem is almost entirely open. For
		example, when \(n=2\), not only is a complete description unknown, but
		only a handful of examples have ever been computed. The
		goal of this project is to use numerical linear algebra and high
		throughput, distributed computing to systematically gather new examples
		of Betti tables of Veronese embeddings of \(\mathbb{P}^n\).

<h4>VirtualResolutions</h4>
<hr>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-xs-12">
		<p style="font-size: 14">
		While graded minimal free resolutions are useful for studying
		quasicoherent sheaves over projective space, when working over a
		product of projective spaces or, more generally, over smooth
		projective toric varieties, graded minimal free resolutions over
		the Cox ring seem too restricted by algebraic structure that is
		in some sense unimportant geometrically. By allowing a limited
		amount of homology, virtual resolutions, first introduced by Berkesch, Erman, and Smith (see arXiv:1703.07631),
		offer a more flexible
		alternative for studying toric subvarieties when compared to
		minimal graded free resolutions.
		
		This Macaulay2 package provides tools for constructing and studying
		virtual resolutions for products of projective spaces. In particular, it
		implements a number of the methods for constructing virtual resolutions
		for products of projective spaces as introduced by Berkesch, Erman, and
		Smith. It contains methods for constructing curves in
		\(\mathbb{P}^1\times\mathbb{P}^2\) as these are a natural source for
		interesting virtual resolutions.
